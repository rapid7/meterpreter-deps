<p>This section contains the user manual of <code><font face="Courier New">wpcap.dll</font></code>, the
dynamic library that contains the public WinPcap API. 
<font face="Times New Roman">wpcap.dll </font>exports a set of
system-independent functions for packet capture and network analysis. These 
functions can be used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>obtain the list of the available network adapters
  <li>retrieve various information about an adapter, like the description and the list of addresses</li>
  <li>sniff the packets using one of the network interface cards of the PC</li>
  <li>send packets to the network
  <li>efficiently save packets to disk and load them with an interface similar to the one of
    live capture</li>
  <li>create packet filters using a high level language and apply them to the captured
    packets</li>
</ul>
<p>wpcap.dll is compatible with libpcap, the well known packet capture library 
for Unix. This compatibility means that one can develop portable network tools 
that will run on the Win32 OS family and on all of the major Unix flavors.</p>
<p>Several portions of the manual present in this section derive directly from the man pages of tcpdump and libpcap, maintained by the tcpdump.org developers. Therefore, if you
are looking for updated docs, you can consult the web site <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org">www.tcpdump.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Some functions are marked <i>deprecated</i>
or <i>discouraged</i>. The meanings of these labels are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>discouraged</i>: the use of another function with similar purpose is
    suggested, however this one is still valid.</li>
  <li><i>deprecated</i>: the function is present only for portability and
    backward compatibility. It should be avoided, and it is strongly suggested
    to use another equivalent function instead.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
