<h2>How to create an application that uses packet.dll</h2>
<p>The creation of an application that uses packet.dll requires the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include the file <i>packet32.h</i> at the beginning of every source file
    that uses the functions exported by the dll. <i>Packet32.h</i> is
    distributed both with the packet.dll source code and with the WinPcap
    developer's pack. It is platform-independent.
  <li>Include <i>packet.lib</i> in the project. <i>Packet.lib</i> is generated
    compiling the packet driver and can be found in the developer's pack.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Remember that</b>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To add a new library to the project with Microsoft Visual C++, you must
    select <em>Settings</em> from the <em>Project</em> menu, then select <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, and then add the name of the new library in the <em>Objcet/library
    modules</em> editbox.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for the libraries,
    you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, <em>library files</em> from the <em>show directories
    for</em> combobox, and the add the path in the <em>directories</em> box.
  <li>To add a new path where Microsoft Visual C++ will look for the include
    files, you must select <em>Options</em> from the <em>Tools</em> menu, then <em>Link</em>
    from the tab control, <em>include files</em> from the <em>show directories
    for</em> combobox, and the add the path in the <em>directories</em> box.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample programs</h2>
<p>A couple of sample programs are provided to show how to use packet.dll. The
source code of the examples, along with all the files needed to compile and run
them, can be found in the <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/install/default.htm">Developer's
Pack</a>.</p>
<p><a href="TestPacketCapture_8c-source.html">TestPacketCapture</a></p>
<p>This is a very simple capture program that tests packet.dll. It is a console
application that once complied can be executed both under Win9x and under WinNTx.
When executed, TestPacketCapture gives to the user the opportunity to choose one of the
adapters installed on the machine, then it captures packets from the specified
network adapter until a key is pressed, dumping the contents of each packet on
the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="TestPacketSend_8c-source.html">Traffic Generator (TestPacketSend)</a></p>
<p>This example shows how to use packet.dll to send packets to the network. It
receives three input parameters: the interface that will be used, the number of
packets to send and their size. The generated packets will have 1:1:1:1:1:1 as
source MAC address, and 2:2:2:2:2:2 as destination address. The 'multiple write'
feature of the driver is used to obtain a higher transmit rate.</p>
